## Shiny Presentation

- The dataset used in the Shiny application is mtcars. We will be regressing mpg on weights and use cylinder as the changing variable. 

- We will examine different linear regression on the different combination of cylinders. 

## Interface

There are only options to choose from:

- The different combinations of cylinders.
- The Linear Regression Line for the selected cylinders
- The Original Line of the Cylinder

The original regression line for all the cylinders are used as a comparison when selecting the different combinations for the trial linear regression.
